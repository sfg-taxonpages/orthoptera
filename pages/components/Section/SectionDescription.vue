            The Orthoptera Species File (OSF) is a taxonomic database of the
            world’s Orthoptera (grasshoppers, locusts, katydids, crickets, and
            related insects) both living and fossil. It has full taxonomic and
            synonymic information for all taxa, with complete taxonomic
            references, images, sound recordings, and specimen records.
          </p>
          <p>
            The core purpose of the OSF is to provide a resource that makes
            research on Orthoptera more efficient as well as to cover the needs
            of policy-makers, environmental managers and the wider public for a
            consistent and up-to-date classification of the world’s Orthoptera
            species.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is open to contributions from anyone with specimen records and
            images.
