# Grants supporting the Orthoptera Species File

The _Orthopterists' Society_, in collaboration with the Illinois Natural History Survey, is offering funding to support projects benefiting the Orthoptera Species File (OSF). Membership in the Orthopterists' Society is required for eligibility. All applications should be submitted to María Marta Cigliano at <address-maker class="font-medium" :items="['cigliano', 'fcnym', 'unlp', 'edu', 'ar']" />.

The total amount of funding available for 2026 is $11,500.\
Applications must be submitted by November 10

## Purpose of the Grant

The grant is intended for projects that directly support the OSF by contributing valuable data. Examples of beneficial contributions include:

- Adding images (e.g., photographs of habitus, diagnostic details of type specimens, other verified museum specimens, living individuals in natural habitats)
- Sound recordings
- Geo-referenced specimen records
- Contributing new diagnostic keys

**Note:** Proposals that focus solely on fieldwork or systematic research without a direct contribution to the OSF will not be considered.\
Projects can span from one to three years.

## Proposal Requirements

Proposals should contain the following:

1. Project Description (maximum of five pages):
   - **Title**
   - **Significance:** Explain the new data expected to add value to OSF, prioritizing taxa currently lacking images, sound recordings, or distribution data.
   - **Objectives, Methods, and Activities:** Detail the proposed goals and how they will be accomplished.
   - **Timetable:** Outline the timeline for the project.
2. **Research Project Summary** _(if applicable)_: Provide a brief summary of how the proposed work fits into broader research objectives.
3. **Curriculum Vitae** _(for all applicants)_
4. **Budget in US Dollars (US$):** Include a detailed budget with justifications for necessary expenses (e.g., travel to museums, fieldwork costs, photographic / sound equipment).
5. **Letter of Agreement/Acknowledgement** _(if applicable)_: A letter from the relevant institution or curator granting permission to access collections and add their images to OSF.
6. **Recommendation Letter** _(for graduate students only)_: A brief endorsement from your advisor or professor confirming the academic scope of your proposal.

Additionally, proposals from curators seeking to support a student to carry out the proposed work under their supervision will also be considered.

## Evaluation Criteria

Proposals will be assessed based on the following:

1. **Contribution to OSF**: Preference will be given to projects expected to add significant new data to OSF, especially data on taxa that are under-illustrated or lack associated sound or distribution information. A detailed list of these poorly represented species and their expected contributions should be included.
2. **Biogeographical Value**: Projects focusing on under-collected geographic regions will be prioritized over those in well-studied areas.
3. **Knowledge of Target Taxa**: Applicants demonstrating familiarity with the taxa involved will have priority.
4. **Methods**: Innovative and effective imaging techniques will be evaluated as part of the proposal.
5. **Type Specimens**: Proposals that involve photographing Orthoptera type specimens—especially those not yet documented in OSF or from museum collections that are otherwise difficult to access—will also be prioritized.

## Additional Information

- Applicants who have received an OSF grant in previous years **must complete the previous project tasks and submit a report approved by the OSF Committee before applying for a new grant**.
- All successful applicants are required to submit a **financial and a activities report** upon the conclusion of their funding period. The activities report should be prepared in a format suitable for publication in _Metaleptea_.
