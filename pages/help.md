## PUBLIC VIEW

This first public version of OSF presented by TaxonPages and curated in a TaxonWorks instance, displays an overview of the most relevant information of the database. The design in panels provides the option to download the data in DwC/CSV formats.
A breadcrumb navigation was designed for taxonomy hierarchy, displayed on the superior margin of each taxon page, and a tree browser for descendants and synonyms is displayed on the right

## SMART SEARCH

Allows to search for a taxon name without needing to write the entire name of the taxon. E.g.: When searching for Zoniopoda tarsata, you may only write "zon tar" and get the complete name as an option to select.

## CONVENTIONS ON VALIDITY OF NAMES

You will see Taxon Names followed by a check mark (✔) in the valid names or a red cross (❌) in the invalid names. Names can also be indicated with [c] corresponding to OTUs created for a new combination of a Taxon Name. Combinations are considered as a separate class of name attached to a valid or invalid protonym in TaxonWorks.

**OTU** (Operational Taxonomic Unit). In TaxonWorks the nomenclature is treated separately from the OTUs, which are the biological units where images, specimens and distribution, as well as other information are linked to.

**Protonym.** This is the first validly published form of a taxon name, e.g. the original combination of a species name.

## TYPE SPECIMEN

The ID number shown in the type specimen panel corresponds to the catalog number of the repository, when available. If not, it corresponds to the occurrence ID provided by TaxonWorks.

## INTERACTIVE MAP

The green Search button on the upper right allows you to delimit an area to find species distributed therein, which will then be listed on the right.

**Asserted Distribution.** Refers to a geographic area for a taxon listed in a publication.

**Collection Objects.** In OSF these are the Specimens.
